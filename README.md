## üìå Workflow

1. Load `movie_reviews` dataset from NLTK
2. Clean and preprocess the text
3. Extract features using Bag-of-Words (DictVectorizer)
4. Train a Naive Bayes model
5. Evaluate using accuracy & classification report
6. Predict sentiment of new custom input

## üí° Sample Output

```python
predict_sentiment("I hated every minute of this boring film. But it was a good start for beginners.")
# Output: 'negative'
